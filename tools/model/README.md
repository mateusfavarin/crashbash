# Crash Bash Model Exporter
This project reads Bash `.mdl` files and exports their mesh and animation data. In order to obtain the `.mdl` files, download the `bash_dat` command line program from [CTR-tools](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-tools/releases).

# Usage
`model.exe model.mdl`: extracts mesh and animation keyframes into `.obj` files.
